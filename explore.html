                <h2 class="animalHeader"> Asian Elephant</h2> 
                <p class="animalInfo"> Today, there are fewer than 52,000 Asian elephants left in the wild. They are also listed as endangered species on the IUCN Red List. The Asian elephant once roamed from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in western Asia as far east as China's Yangtze River. The majority have been eliminated from western Asia completely. From substantial parts of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and almost entirely from China.
                <br><br>
                    The greatest threat to wild Asian elephants is habitat loss and fragmentation. Throughout the tropics, humans have cleared large areas of forest and have rapidly populated river valleys and plains. 
                    <br><br>
                    The international ivory trade has contributed far more to the decline of African elephants than Asian ones over the last few decades. Also, many young elephants are removed from the wild to supply tourist and entertainment industries.

                <h2 class="animalHeader"> Giant Panda</h2> 
                <p class="animalInfo"> Native to the mountain forests of southwest China, the giant panda is one of the most beloved animals in the world. With only around 2060 pandas living in the wild, the giant panda is considered vulnerable of extinction by the IUCN Red List. 
                <br><br>
                Due to the fact that pandas reproduce so infrequently, it is very difficult for their population to recover from such a low point.
                One the main reasons that panda populations have declined is habitat destruction. As the human population in China continues to grow, pandas' habitat gets taken over by development, pushing them into smaller and less livable areas. Habitat destruction also leads to food shortages since pandas feed on several varieties of bamboo that bloom at different times of the year.
                To combat this issue, the Chinese government has actively worked to restore and protect bamboo habitat, and these measures have shown positive results.

                <h2 class="animalHeader"> Tiger</h2> 
                <p class="animalInfo"> Tigers are globally listed as “Endangered” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. The Malayan and Sumatran sub-species are listed as “Critically Endangered.” Wild tigers are hunted to meet the demands of the $20 billion a year illegal wildlife market. Tigers are exploited and abused in the wild and in captivity.
            <br><br>
                    Wild tigers have been brought to the brink of extinction; fewer than 4,000 remain worldwide, and the number may be as low as 3,000. In fact, more tigers live in captivity in the U.S. than exist in the wild globally.
            <br><br>
                    Born Free is working to help make sure that tigers are given the best chance at thriving in the wild. In central India, the Satpuda Landscape Tiger Programme (SLTP) is implementing grassroots community conservation activities to prevent conflict between people and tigers. And, Born Free's sanctuary at Bannerghatta in India provides lifetime care to tigers in need of rescue.</p>

                <h2 class="animalHeader"> Hawksbill Sea Turtle</h2> 
                <p class="animalInfo"> Considered by many to be the most beautiful of sea turtles for their colorful shells, the hawksbill is found in tropical waters around the world. Their population has declined more than 80% in the last century, primarily due to the trade in their beautiful shell. The shell is used for items such as jewelry, combs, and brushes, and inlay in furniture and other decorative pieces. 
            <br><br>        
                 Other threats include the destruction of nesting and feeding habitats, pollution, boat strikes, coastal development, entanglement in fishing gear, consumption of their meat and eggs, and destructive fishing practices like dynamite fishing.
            <br><br> 
                    Hawksbills are important inhabitants of coral reefs. By consuming sponges, they play an important role in the reef community, aiding corals in growth. It’s estimated that one turtle can consume over 1,000 pounds of sponges per year. Without them, sponges can overgrow corals and suffocate reefs.

                <h2 class="animalHeader"> Snow Leopard</h2> 
                <p class="animalInfo"> Rarely sighted, snow leopards inhabit the high mountains of Central Asia over an expansive twelve-country range. They were previously listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List as Endangered. Since 2016, however, their status has been listed as Vulnerable, which is one level less urgent. Which classifies “species threatened with global extinction.” 
            <br><br>
                Snow leopards are treated with poaching. Their fur is highly valued, while their bones and other body parts are sought as ingredients in traditional medicine. Habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation are also threats to Snow leopards. Organizations are working to support snow leopard conservation. </p>

                <p class="animalInfo"> The American peregrine falcon is one of the best known raptors in North America. Many people are aware of the population decline of this species due to problems with egg-shell thinning caused by persistent organic pollutants such as DDT. 
                <br><br>
                Populations of this species were driven to the brink of extinction and the peregrine falcon was federally listed as an endangered species in 1973. The American peregrine falcon was removed from the endangered species list in 1999. However, it is vital that we do our part to keep our environments safe so that they along with other birds can stay off of that list. </p>
